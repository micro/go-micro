Documentation for the Go Micro framework 

## Overview

Go Micro is a framework for microservices development. 
It's built on a powerful pluggable architecture using 
Go interfaces. Go Micro defines the foundations for 
distributed systems development which includes 
service discovery, client/server rpc and pubsub. 
Additionally Go Micro contains other primitives 
such as auth, caching and storage. All of this 
is encapsulated in a high level service interface.
