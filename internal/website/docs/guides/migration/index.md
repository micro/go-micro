# Migration Guides

Step-by-step guides for migrating to Go Micro from other frameworks.

## Available Guides

- [From gRPC](from-grpc.md) - Migrate from gRPC to Go Micro with minimal code changes

## Coming Soon

We're working on additional migration guides:

- **From go-kit** - Migrate from Go kit microservices framework
- **From Standard Library** - Upgrade from net/http and net/rpc
- **From Gin/Echo** - Transition from HTTP-only frameworks
- **From Micro v3** - Upgrade from older Go Micro versions

## Why Migrate to Go Micro?

- **Pluggable Architecture** - Swap components without changing code
- **Zero Configuration** - Works out of the box with sensible defaults  
- **Progressive Enhancement** - Start simple, add complexity when needed
- **Unified Abstractions** - Registry, transport, broker, store all integrated
- **Active Development** - Regular updates and community support

## Need Help?

- Check the [Framework Comparison](../comparison.md) guide
- Review [Architecture Decisions](../../architecture/index.md) to understand design choices
- Ask questions in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/micro/go-micro/discussions)
- See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../../../CONTRIBUTING.md) to contribute new migration guides
