# Go Micro 2026: The AI-Native Era

## The Paradigm Shift

**APIs served apps. MCP serves agents.**

Go Micro is evolving from an API-first framework to an **AI-native platform** where every microservice is accessible to AI agents by default.

## Vision

> **Make every microservice AI-native by default.**

## Strategic Focus

### Q1 2026: MCP Foundation ✅
- [x] MCP library and CLI integration
- [x] Service discovery and tool generation
- [x] Documentation and launch

**Result:** Services become AI-accessible with 3 lines of code.

### Q2 2026: Agent Developer Experience

**Stdio Transport**
- Claude Code integration
- `micro mcp` command suite
- Auto-detection of transport type

**Tool Descriptions**
- Parse Go comments for descriptions
- Schema generation from struct tags
- Better context for agents

**Agent SDKs**
- LangChain integration
- LlamaIndex support
- AutoGPT compatibility

**Developer Tools**
- Interactive agent playground
- Real-time tool call monitoring
- Testing and debugging tools

### Q3 2026: Production & Scale

**Enterprise MCP Gateway**
- Standalone production gateway
- Horizontal scaling
- Rate limiting and analytics
- Multi-tenant support

**Observability**
- OpenTelemetry integration
- Agent usage tracking
- Performance dashboards
- Cost attribution

**Security**
- OAuth2 for agents
- Scope-based permissions
- Audit logging
- Agent identity validation

**Deployment**
- Kubernetes operator
- Helm charts
- Service mesh integration
- Auto-scaling

### Q4 2026: Ecosystem & Monetization

**Agent Marketplace**
- Pre-built agents using go-micro services
- Customer support, DevOps, Sales agents
- Community contributions
- Marketplace revenue share

**Business Model**
- **Open Source:** Core framework (free forever)
- **Go Micro Cloud:** Managed MCP gateway (SaaS)
- **Enterprise:** On-premise, advanced security
- **Services:** Consulting and training

**Strategic Integrations**
- Anthropic (Claude) partnership
- OpenAI (ChatGPT) plugins
- Google Gemini support
- Microsoft Copilot integration

## 2027: Platform Dominance

Go Micro becomes the **platform layer between AI and infrastructure**:

```
AI Agents → Go Micro (MCP) → Microservices
```

**Features:**
- Autonomous service discovery
- Multi-agent orchestration
- Intelligent routing
- Development copilot

## Business Model

### Revenue Streams
1. **Go Micro Cloud (SaaS)** - $1M Year 1 → $5M Year 2
2. **Enterprise Licenses** - $500K → $3M
3. **Professional Services** - $250K → $750K
4. **Marketplace** - $100K → $500K

**Total Projected Revenue:**
- Year 1: $1.85M (65% profit margin)
- Year 2: $9.25M (81% profit margin)

### Why High Margins?
