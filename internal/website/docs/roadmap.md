# Go Micro Roadmaps

Go Micro has two roadmaps:

## 🚀 [2026 Roadmap: The AI-Native Era](roadmap-2026) (NEW)

**Focus:** MCP integration and agent-first development

This is the **strategic roadmap** focused on making Go Micro the leading framework for AI-native microservices:

- MCP as the primary integration method
- Agent developer experience
- Production MCP gateways
- Business model and sustainability
- Strategic integrations (Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini)

## Which Roadmap Should I Follow?

**If you're building AI-native services or integrating with agents:**
→ Follow the [2026 Roadmap](roadmap-2026)

**If you're working on core framework features or traditional microservices:**
→ Follow the [General Roadmap](https://github.com/micro/go-micro/blob/master/ROADMAP.md)

**Both roadmaps are complementary.** The 2026 roadmap focuses on MCP and AI integration, while the general roadmap covers broader framework improvements.
